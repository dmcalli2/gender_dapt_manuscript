# Absolute risk reduction by cause for all analyses
The following series of plots show estimated absolute risk reduction at one-year for death from cardiovascular, bleeding and competing (non-cardiovascular, non-bleeding) causes, as well as all-cause mortality.
Each small multiple represents the results from a model with different treatment effects from the main analysis and each of the sensitivity analyses.
The left-hand column shows the results from the sex-treatment interaction for MACE estimated from the data. The right-hand column shows the results from an assumed null interaction.
The rows show the estimated treatment effect for a range of different sex-treatment interactions for bleeding.

# Detailed model description

## Relative treatment effects

The following equations define the shared model. In order to reduce the number of subscripts, and for compatibility with the structure of the data and comparability with the BUGS code, the likelihood and link functions are given separately for men and women allocated to the treatment and control arms. rmc, rwc, rmt and rwt represent the event numbers in men and women in the control groups and men and women in the treatment groups respectively. The number of participants in these groups are represented by nmc, nwc, nmt and nwt respectively. z indexes the trial. Consistent with the BUGS language, the following normal distributions are parameterised in terms of the mean and precision.


### Likelihood and link function

Men controls
$$ rmc_z \sim Bin(pmc_z, nmc_z)  $$
$$ cloglog(pmc_z) = log(time_z) +  \mu_z $$

Women controls
$$ rwc_z \sim Bin(pwc_z, nwc_z)  $$
$$ cloglog(pwc_z) = log(time_z) +  mu_z + wu_z   $$

Men treatment
$$ rmt_z \sim Bin(pmt_z, nmt_z)  $$
$$ cloglog(pmt_z) = log(time_z) +  mu_z +         d_z$$    


Women treatment
$$ rwt_z \sim Bin(pwt_z, nwt_z)  $$
$$ cloglog(pwt_z) = log(time_z) +  mu_z + wu_z + d_z + wd_z $$

### Priors 

Independent priors at the level of each trial were used for the intercept, female-sex and treatment effect in men. A shared prior was used for the sex-treatment interaction.

Intercept (ie baseline for each trial)
$$ mu_z \sim N(0, 0.0001) $$

Effect of female sex
$$ wu_z \sim N(0, 0.0001) $$

Treatment effect in men
$$ d_z  \sim N(0, 0.0001) $$
Shared across trials

Sex-treatment interaction
$$ wd_z \sim N(wd\_delta, wd\_tau)$$

Meta-analysis level priors

Sex-treatment interaction across trials
$$ wd\_delta \sim N(0, 0.0001)$$
Between-trial variation in sex-treatment interaction (precision)
$$ wd\_tau =  1/wd\_var $$
Between-trial variation in sex-treatment interaction (variance)
$$  wd\_var \sim lognormal(-3.23, 1/1.88^2) $$
A weakly informative prior was used for the between-trial variation in sex-treatment interaction ($wd\_var$) as variance parameters are often difficult to fit and this parameter was not the main focus of the analysis. The $lognormal(-3.23, 1/1.88^2)$ prior was chosen from among the set of off-the-shelf priors from Turner et al 2012. Turner et al identified a set of priors for modelling heterogeneity in main treatment effects rather than interactions, and on the log-odds scale rather than the rate ratio scale. Nonetheless, we used this prior as it was felt to be sufficiently wide.

The likelihood and link functions were the same for the "identical" sex-treatment effect model. However, the sex-treatment interaction parameter $wd$ was identical for all trials and so was not indexed and had a single prior ($N(0, 0.001)$).
 
The model stratified by the three treatment comparisons (clopidogrel versus placebo in stroke, clopidogrel versus placebo in ACS and ticagrelor or prasugrel versus clopidogrel in ACS) was also similar to this model. However,an additional index for treatment comparison was added to allow the sex-treatment interaction to vary between comparisons
$wd\_delta_c \sim N(0, 0.0001)$. The between trial variance was assumed to be identical for all treatment comparisons.

### Summarising treatment effects

Using samples from the posterior distributions from these models, treatment effects for men were added to the sex-treatment interation (both on the log-RR scale) to estimate the sex-specific log-RR for women. The resultant sex-specific log-RRs for women and men were summarised using non-linear least squares in R, assuming a t-distribution.

## Baseline risk model

We modelled cause-specific deaths from bleeding, cardiovascular disease and non-bleeding non-cardiovascular causes using a hierarchical generalized linear regression model with a multinomial likelihood and log link, as these outcomes are mutually exclusive.

In this model the i subscript refers to each row of the data, which is provided below the model. Each j subscript refers to each of the three outcomes.

Likelihood
$y_{i,j}  \sim Multinomial (p_{i,j}, N_i)$ with $\sum p_{i,j}=1$

Linear predictor and link function
$$ log(p_{i,j})= \alpha0_j + \alpha1_j *age_i+ \alpha2_j*gender_i $$



```{r}
br <- read.csv("data/baseline_risk_actual_data.csv", as.is = TRUE)
br[, -7]
```

## Application of relative treatment effects to baseline risk model to estimate absolute treatment effects.

Within JAGS we combined the estimates from the baseline model and the relative treatment effect models for the bleeding and cardiovascular outcomes to estimate the absolute risk reduction for cause-specific mortality from bleeding and from cardiovascular death as well as from all-cause mortality. For men and women, this was done through the following model.

$$log(pnew_{i,j} )=\alpha0_j + \alpha1_j*age_i + \alpha2_j*gender_i + men\_logrr_j + women\_logrr_j*gender_i$$
In this model the i subscript refers to each row of the data, as shown above. Also as before the j subscript refers to each of the three outcomes. $men\_logrr_j$ and $women\_logrr_j$ refer to the log-rate ratios for the effect of treatment in men and women respectively. From this model the absolute risk reduction for deaths from bleeding, cardiovascular and non-bleeding non-cardiovascular causes as well as for all causes were derived as follows. 

$$ arr_j =  \frac{1}{\sum n_i} * \sum_{i} (n_i*(p_{i,j} - pnew_{i,j}))  $$

$$ arr = \sum_j arr_j$$

# Model assumptions

The following assumptions were required for this analysis:-

- Sex-treatment interactions are exchangeable between trials within the same drug-class
- Sex-specific relative treatment effects are transportable from the clinical trial populations to the target Scottish population
- For the age-specific analysis that non-collapsability does not importantly affect the age-specific rate ratios
- That the rate ratio for non-cardiovascular, non-bleeding events is null.
- That the rate ratios for TIMI bleeding and MACE are the same as the rate ratios for bleeding death and cardiovascular death respectively. This involves the following assumptions:-
	- that bleeding deaths within one year cannot occur without TIMI major bleeding within one-year (with a similar assumption for MACE and cardiovascular deaths). This assumption is actually true by definition as TIMI major bleeding and MACE both include death from bleeding and cardiovascular death respectively as part of their outcome definitions
	- that the proportion of TIMI bleeding events which are bleeding deaths is not altered by treatment (ie that treatment may modify the proportion of patients who experience bleeding within one-year, but not the spectrum of bleeding severity) and that the proportion of MACE events which are cardiovascular deaths are similarly not altered by the treatment (ie that conditional on conditional on having a bleeding (or MACE event), the risk of a bleeding (or cardiovascular) death is not related to treatment)
