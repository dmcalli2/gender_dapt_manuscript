# Absolute risk reduction by cause for all analyses
The following series of plots show estimated absolute risk reduction at one-year for death from cardiovascular, bleeding and competing (non-cardiovascular, non-bleeding) causes, as well as all-cause mortality.
Each small multiple represents the results from a model with different treatment effects from the main analysis and each of the sensitivity analyses.
The left-hand column shows the results from the sex-treatment interaction for MACE estimated from the data. The right-hand column shows the results from an assumed null interaction.
The rows show the estimated treatment effect for a range of different sex-treatment interactions for bleeding.
