# Absolute risk reduction by cause for all analyses
The following series of plots show estimated absolute risk reduction at one-year for death from cardiovascular, bleeding and competing (non-cardiovascular, non-bleeding) causes, as well as all-cause mortality.
Each small multiple represents the results from a model with different treatment effects from the main analysis and each of the sensitivity analyses.
The left-hand column shows the results from the sex-treatment interaction for MACE estimated from the data. The right-hand column shows the results from an assumed null interaction.
The rows show the estimated treatment effect for a range of different sex-treatment interactions for bleeding.

# Re-analysis of data from recently published paper by Lau et al.

We re-analysed data provided in the Lau et al paper, as well as a combination of data obtained in our systematic review as well as the Lau et al paper using the "shared" model as described in the main manuscript.

```{r}
source("scripts/01_read_data.R")
load("model_summaries/jags_samples_main.Rdata")
inter_q <- as.data.frame(t(format(round(inter_q,2), nsmall = 2)))
inter_q$interaction <- paste0( inter_q[,1], " (", inter_q[,2], "-", inter_q[,3], ")")
inter_q <- inter_q[c("re", "lau", "lau_sa"), "interaction", drop = FALSE]
row.names(inter_q) <- c("Main analysis", "Lau et al", "Both systematic reviews")
colnames(inter_q) <- "Sex-treatment interaction rate ratio"
inter_q$Trials <- map_int(list(main, lau, lau_sa), nrow)
inter_q <- inter_q[, c("Trials", "Sex-treatment interaction rate ratio")]
knitr::kable(inter_q)
```

# Assumptions

The following assumptions were required for this analysis:-
- Sex-treatment interactions are exchangeable between trials within the same drug-class
- Sex-specific relative treatment effects are transportable from the clinical trial populations to the target Scottish population
- For the age-specific analysis that non-collapsability does not importantly affect the age-specific rate ratios
- Relative treatment effects on MACE are the same as relative treatment effects on cardiovascular death. This assumption is satisfied if cardiovascular deaths are a subset of MACE events and if the following Markov property holds; that conditional on having a MACE event, the risk of a cardiovascular death is similar to that of not having a MACE event.
- As above except for bleeding events and bleeding deaths
- That the rate ratio for non-cardiovascular, non-bleeding events is null.
